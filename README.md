Falvey Library Scan Lab Utilities

This repository contains utilities used for file processing in Falvey Library's scan lab.

  * CardSorter.php - takes the output of a card scanning routine and splits it into separate job folders for each front/back pair of scans.
  * folderize.bat - takes all image files in a directory and moves each to a folder; useful for splitting a collection of images into separate jobs before upload to VuDL.
